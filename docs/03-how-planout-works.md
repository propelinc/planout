# How PlanOut works

PlanOut works by hashing input data into numbers, and using these numbers to generate what are effectively pseudo-random values to pick numbers. All PlanOut operators include basic unit tests (link) to verify that they generate assignments with the expected distribution.

Good randomization procedures produce assignments that are independent of one another. Below, we show how PlanOut uses experiment-level and variable-level "salts" (strings that get appended to the data thats being hashed) to make sure that variables within and across experiments remain independent.

## Pseudo-random assignment through hashing
Consider the following experiment:
```python
class SharingExperiment(SimpleExperiment):
  def set_attributes(self):
    self.name = 'sharing_name'
    self.salt = 'sharing_salt'

  def assign(self, params, userid):
    params.button_text = UniformChoice(
      choices=['OK', 'Share', 'Share with friends'],
      unit=userid
    )
```
Here, we define a single randomized parameter, `button_text`. The assignment is generated by first composing a string containing experiment-level salt, `sharing_salt`, the parameter-level salt `button_text`, and the input unit. By default, PlanOut uses the variable name as the parameter-level salt.

When we choose the button text for a particular unit, e.g.,

```python
SharingExperiment(userid=4).get('button_text')
```

PlanOut would compute the SHA1 checksum for:
```
sharing_salt.button_text.4
```
and then use the last few digits of this checksum to index into the given list of `choices`.  Since SHA1 is cryptographically safe, even minor changes to the hashing string (e.g., considering `userid=41` instead of 4) will result in a totally different number.

Multiple units are handled through concatenation. Had the `unit` parameter been `unit=[userid, url]`,

```python
SharingExperiment(userid=4, url='http://www.facebook.com').get('button_text')
```

PlanOut would compute the SHA1 checksum for:
```
sharing_salt.button_text.4.http://www.facebook.com
```

Note that because PlanOut simply concatenates the units, the order in which you specify lists of units matters.


## Salts

### Experiment-level salts
Experiment-level salts can be manually in the  `set_attributes()` method (as we have above). If the salt is not specified, then the experiment name is used as the salt. With SimpleExperiment, if the name is not set in `set_attributes()`, then the name of the class is used as the experiment name.

### Parameter-level salts
The parameter name is automatically used to salt random assignment operations, but parameter level salts can be specified manually. For example, in the following code

```python
params.x = UniformChoice(choices=['a','b'], unit=userid)
params.y = UniformChoice(choices=['a','b'], unit=userid, salt='x')
```

both `x` and `y` will always be assigned to the same exact same value.

This lets you change the name of the variable you are logging without changing the assignment. Use variable level salts with caution, since they might lead to failures in randomization (link).

### Salts with namespaces
Namespaces (link) are a way to manage concurrent and iterative experiments. When using `SimpleNamespace`, the namespace-level salt is appended to the experiment-level salt. This ensures that random assignment is independent across experiments with the same name running under different namespaces.
