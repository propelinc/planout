# About PlanOut
PlanOut was originally developed by Eytan Bakshy and Dean Eckles at Facebook as a language for  describing experimental designs. PlanOut is one of a few ways of setting up experiments at Facebook. The PlanOut interpreter runs on top of QuickExperiment, which is developed by Breno Roberto and Wesley May.

This open source release accompanies "Designing and Deploying Online Field Experiments", which describes the PlanOut language and the semantics of our deployment and logging infrastructure.

We hope that the software is useful for researchers and small businesses who want to run experiments out of the box, but have also tried to build things in a way that is easy to port and adapt to work with production systems.
